                  In recent years, the excessive growth of freshwater aquatic
                  weeds has become the major source of various environmental
                  problems in shallow lakes, rivers and irrigation channel in
                  Japan. For instance, in South Basin of Lake Biwa (the largest
                  lake in Japan), submerged-type aquatic weeds such as Egeria
                  densa, Elodea nuttallii and Potamogeton maackianus have been
                  covering more than 90% of the lake surface and causing
                  social/economic problems such as fishery disturbance, foul
                  odor and deterioration of tourism attractiveness. Both
                  national and local government of Japan has been dealing with
                  this urgent issue. The harvesting and treatment of aquatic
                  weeds have been promoted by "Plan for Conservation of Lake
                  Water Quality" (the Ministry of the Environment) and "Mother
                  Lake 21 Plan" (Shiga Prefecture).
                </p>
                <div class="clear"></div>

                <p>
                  Currently, harvested aquatic weeds have been removed mainly by
                  bottom trawling by fishing vessel, but it gives rise to
                  concern about acceleration of arsenic dissolution from lake
                  sediment. In addition, maintaining moderate amount of aquatic
                  weeds is essential for healthy lake ecosystem, since aquatic
                  weeds play a significant role in water purification and
                  habitat for fishes and invertebrates. Therefore, our project
                  aims to find out the effect of various aquatic weed removal
                  methods on biological community, water quality and sediment
                  quality, by establishing several experimental mesocosms in
                  South Basin of Lake Biwa. Throughout this experiment, we will
                  formulate "sustainable aquatic weed management standard".
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the past, harvested aquatic weeds have traditionally been
                  utilized for fertilizer, but currently it has mainly been
                  incinerated due to the popularization of chemical fertilizer.
                  For the biorefinery from aquatic weed biomass, bioethanol
                  production potential has been investigated, but there are
                  several more steps to achieve the implementation such as cost
                  and bioenergy recovery efficiency. On the other hand,
                  anaerobic digestion (AD) has been given its attention in terms
                  of low-cost treatment and feasibility to bioenergy recovery
                  from "wet" organic waste. Most of the AD process has focused
                  only on biogas recovery from carbon fraction of the waste
                  biomass. Therefore, our project aims to establish fundamental
                  technology for effective biorefinery from aquatic weed
                  biomass, by enhancing not only biomethane recovery, but also
                  biorefinery from nutrients (N, P, K) in digestate by producing
                  microalgae biomass.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By establishing "lake ecosystem management standard" and
                  "effective utilization (technology) of aquatic weed biomass",
                  we approach toward the solution of aquatic weed issue.
