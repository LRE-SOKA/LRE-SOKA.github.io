                    as filthy water and raw garbage discharged from urban

                    fermentation. These studies are relevant to the research on

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    In Japan, an annual emission of solid organic waste like
                    food waste comes to almost 20 million tons, and its
                    treatment has been quite problematic. Methane fermentation
                    is receiving particular attention as an energy-producing
                    treatment method of organic waste, because it is accompanied
                    by the production of utilizable energy, methane gas.
                    Wet-methane-fermentation treatment method is especially
                    useful, because it allows solid organic waste to be directly
                    thrown into its process. Indeed, improving this method is an
                    important research theme in this laboratory, because various
                    microbial communities are involved in processes of
                    wet-methane-fermentation, such as hydrolysis, acid
                    production, and methane production. In order to stably
                    process the treatment method by stabilizing bacterial
                    density, we have investigated how to maintain concentrated
                    bacterial density in a wet-methane-fermentation reactor.

                    In anaerobic digestion, various microorganisms contribute to
                    hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methane fermentation
                    processes, and it is necessary to maintain stable
                    microorganism concentration in order to achieve steady waste
                    treatment. Our laboratory has achieved a stable methane
                    fermentation with 2 to 5-fold higher organic loading rate
                    than standard fermentation method by recirculating sludge,
                    containing microorgasms, back to the reactor (Right figure:

                      >Nagao et al., 2012</a
                    >). Furthermore, we found that by creating "resting period",
                    during which substrate supply is stopped, the microorganism
                    concentration increases dramatically. Currently, we are
                    aiming to reveal the mechanism behind the microorganism
                    growth during resting period by studying the relationship
                    between growth and digestate characteristics.

                    <a name="2-2"></a>II. Promotion of efficient methane
                    fermentation process using algal biomass(-2013)
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    Due to eutrophication caused by population growth, mass
                    generation of marine algae has been observed globally in
                    recent years. Marine algae are washed ashore and cause a
                    variety of environmental problems by deteriorating scenery
                    and producing foul odors. Moreover, such drifted wastes have
                    high moisture content and cost too much to burn them up.
                    Aquatic biomass, including such algae, contains a lot of
                    organic substances which are utilizable as biomass energy.
                    However, aquatic biomass is inadequate for biological
                    processing like methane fermentation, because persistent
                    substances cause the decrease of decomposition rate,
                    followed by a drop in biogas recovery efficiency. In order
                    to improve the waste decomposition rate, it is imperative to
                    increase substrate availability of microbes which are active
                    in the methane fermentation process. Therefore, we are
                    investigated how pulverizing aquatic biomass could
                    contribute to improve energy recovery efficiency.
                    <br />Algal biomass attracts attention not only for its
                    importance in the waste disposal process, but also for its
                    high productivity. <em>Chlorella zofingiensis</em>, a
                    species of green algae, shows high cell multiplication rate
                    and accumulates astaxanthin that is a useful substance with
                    high commercial value. Establishing an efficient culture
                    method of commercially high-value phytoplankton is
                    instrumental for producing utilizable substances and energy,
                    and this had been another research topic in this laboratory.

                    process using the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB)
                    method (-2013)
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    The UASB is a mid-to-high-concentrative method of sewage
                    disposal through which methane gas is retrievable. The UASB
                    triggers self-granulation of microbial community involved in
                    methane fermentation and form granules of 0.5-2.0 mm in
                    diameter in the sludge. Granules have excellent
                    sedimentation properties and hold highly concentrated
                    microbes, so it is useful for heavily-loaded operations. For
                    these practical characteristics, the USAB has been globally
                    adopted since the 1980s. Using this method, we have
                    conducted a research aiming to recover methane gas from raw
                    garbage. <br />However, the UASB is not suitable for
                    treating solid waste. It is more useful for disposal of
                    moist waste. In order to make solid raw garbage applicable
                    for the UASB, we solubilized them and lower its solid
                    concentration. After that, we disposed raw garbage through
                    the USAB method and investigated methane gas recovery in the
                    process. Also, in order to formulate granules appropriate
                    for raw-garbage-effluent disposal, we studied granule
                    production from digestive sludge using raw-garbage effluent.
                    In addition, in Japan, where its land is surrounded by the
                    ocean, fishing is an important industry and high-salinity
                    effluent is discharged from the processing plants of marine
                    products. From this perspective, salinity resistance of
                    granules had been also studied in this laboratory.

                    landfill in Surabaya city, Indonesia(-2013)
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    In Japan, nearly 78% of waste winds up in a landfill after
                    incineration. Meanwhile, in many developing countries like
                    Indonesia, wastes are not sorted, and industrial discharges
                    are directly dumped in landfills. Due to this inappropriate
                    waste treatment, organic matters within the disposed wastes
                    are biodegraded in the landfill, and greenhouse gas, such as
                    CO<sub>2</sub> and Methane, are emitted. Moreover, rainfall
                    on the landfill produces leachate with dissolved waste
                    constituents. Because most landfills in developing countries
                    do not have facilities for gas recovery, water stop or
                    leachate treatment, discharges from landfills have been
                    causes of environmental problems as they accelerate global
                    warming and contaminate groundwater and the ocean.
                    <br />Soka University had undertaken a joint study with
                    Surabaya Institute of Technology (ITS) since 2004. Through
                    this joint study, we aimed to develop a low-cost leachate
                    treatment which is feasible for developing countries.
                    Studies have been investigating chemical quality of leachate
                    from the Benowo landfill.

                    (LCA) (-2013)
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    The LCA is a method which quantitatively evaluates
                    environmental impacts of a product/system by looking at its
                    whole process from production to disposal. Adopting this
                    method to assess environmental effects of a disposal process
                    helps us to specify a more appropriate and
                    environmental-friendly disposal method. In Japan, nearly 80%
                    of domestic waste is incinerated, the recycling rate of
                    organic waste, such as food waste, only remains about 9%. In
                    such situation, the Food Recycling Law became effective in
                    2001 (amended later in 2007), and a recognition system of
                    "food loop" was established. This is a food-recycling
                    process in which food waste is locally processed into
                    composts or feeds and bought by local food-related companies
                    for their businesses. In this way, "local production for
                    local consumption" is further encouraged. Not only important
                    for promoting food waste recycling, comprehensive
                    evaluations like the LCA are also important to specify and
                    establish an appropriate eco-friendly disposal process to
                    realize a low-carbon society. Focusing on this food loop, we
                    were assessing environmental and economic effects of
                    food-waste disposal process. By doing so, we comprehensively
                    evaluated environmental effects of food loop and find out
                    its advantages and disadvantages.

                    Microalgae are superior to terrestrial plants in terms of
                    carbon dioxide assimilation rate, and therefore algal
                    biomass can be produced effectively incorporating nutrients
                    from organic wastewater. Microalgae also produce fatty
                    acids, protein, and carotenoid that can be transformed into
                    medical, cosmetic, health, and feeding products. Currently,
                    our laboratory focuses on both biomass production and
                    wastewater treatment using microalgae.

                    Activated sludge processes are widely used wastewater
                    treatment using aerobic bacteria. However, it requires a
                    large amount of cost and energy due to mechanical aeration
                    for O<sub>2</sub> supply and chemical additives for nutrient
                    removal. In 1957, Oswald et al. proposed an alternative
                    wastewater treatment using algal-bacterial system, which
                    uses microalgae with bacteria. In this system, bacteria
                    remove organic matter in wastewater using O<sub>2</sub>
                    supplied by algal photosynthesis, and microalgae remove
                    nutrients using CO<sub>2</sub> released by bacterial
                    respiration. Therefore, both organic matter and nutrients
                    can be removed at relatively low cost and energy without
                    mechanical aeration and chemical additives compared to the
                    conventional aerobic wastewater treatments. Our laboratory
                    is studying the treatment of organic wastewater at high
                    loading rates using 1.2 m<sub>3</sub> of high rate algal
                    pond (HRAP) and the removal of bisphenol A using
                    algal-bacterial consortia.

                    A unicellular green alga,
                    <span class="italic">Chlorella zofingiensis</span> is known
                    to produce astaxanthin, a type of carotenoid that has
                    recently become commercialized. The body content of
                    astaxanthin in
                    <span class="italic">C. zofingiensis</span> is relatively
                    smaller than
                    <span class="italic">Haematococcus plurivalis</span>, its
                    fast growth rate may improve the productivity of commercial
                    astaxanthin production, if mass cultivation system of
                    <span class="italic">C. zofingiensis</span> is established.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a standard algal cultivation method, increasing cell
                    density led to a lower growth rate because of "self-shading"
                    that prevents effective light penetration. Therefore, in
                    order to achieve a high density culture of
                    <span class="italic">C. zofingiensis</span>, we developed a
                    tubular photobioreactor cultivation system that avoids
                    self-shading and effectively utilize photo energy, combined
                    with carbon dioxide and nutrient supply control system.
