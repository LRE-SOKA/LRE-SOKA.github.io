                    coastal organisms placed in the lower trophic level, such as
                    phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria. We are also
                    analyzing mid-to-long-term variation of the coastal
                    ecosystem and factors contributing to this phenomenon.
                    Investigating an increasing number of typhoons and their
                    effects on the coastal ecosystem is another research topic
                    in this field.

                  <p>
                    Sagami Bay opens its entrance to the Pacific, receiving
                    Kuroshio Current from the south and Oyashio Current from the
                    north toward its center. Also, Sagami and Sakawa Rivers run
                    into the west of the bay, forming low salinity water on the
                    surface layer. Such a complex structure of the water mass in
                    Sagami Bay enables diverse ocean biota to be formed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Manazuru Peninsula is located in the west part of Sagami
                    Bay. Around the peninsula, the inflow stream from Kuroshio
                    Current branches off in the bay and goes up northward along
                    Izu Peninsula while another stream hits Miura Peninsula in
                    the east of the bay and turns its direction southward along
                    Shounan coast. These two tides meet at Manazuru Peninsula
                    and create a rip current. That is why Manazuru Peninsula is
                    known as one of better fishing places in Sagami Bay.

                    environment and biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton

                    From spring to summer at coastal regions of the Temperate
                    zone, phytoplankton, autotrophic organisms that
                    photosynthesize and independently gain energy, start to
                    increase very rapidly. This growth is caused by the increase
                    of solar radiation and water temperature as well as
                    inflowing nutrients from rivers. As the growth of
                    phytoplankton continues, zooplankton grows rapidly by
                    preying on phytoplankton, and productive energy is
                    eventually transferred to the organisms at higher trophic
                    levels, such as fish. By investigating biomass, species
                    compositions, and the mechanism of community succession of
                    phytoplankton and zooplankton, we are able to analyze the
                    production-ecological role of the plankton community as food
                    sources for industrially important fishes. This
                    investigation also helps us to understand mid-to-long term
                    variations of the marine environment and their causes as
                    well as how to evaluate anthropogenic impacts on the
                    environment.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    When harmful phytoplankton increases in high density, it is
                    called Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). It is often pointed out
                    that HABs are globally expanding both in terms of its
                    frequency and magnitude. In order to alleviate and prevent
                    damage from HABs, it is imperative to expeditiously predict
                    its occurrence of harmful algae through precise detection,
                    identification and quantification. An identification method
                    using morphological characters had been adopted, but this
                    was problematic for its poor accuracy and inefficient
                    operation. In order to overcome these problems, different
                    methods have been devised, such as Real-Time PCR method for
                    its better quantification quality and FISH method for its
                    speedy analysis. Through these advanced methods, expeditious
                    and accurate monitoring of harmful algae can be conducted in
                    the coastal area of Sagami bay. This development also leads
                    to an established system for monitoring, predicting and
                    warning HABs breakout. Consequently, the study on HABs is
                    expected to prevent HABs from damaging fisheries,
                    contaminating human food supplies in the case of polluted
                    seafood, and contributing to the deterioration of the
                    coastal environment.

                  <p>
                    Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) is generally regarded as
                    organic carbon which passes through a filter with 0.7 um of
                    its pore size. Majority of oceanic organic substances exist
                    in a form of DOC, and they function as a huge carbon
                    storage, which almost equals to the quantity of CO2 in the
                    air. By this means, DOC plays an important role for material
                    circulation in the ocean. In the coastal area of Sagami Bay,
                    the bacteria-utilizing DOC was found to mainly result from
                    the biological production process in the water column.

                    While ecological disturbance could destroy the structure of
                    ecosystems, it is also regarded as a necessary process for
                    maintaining healthy ecosystems. Natural factors that cause
                    ecological disturbance include typhoons, monsoons, El Nino
                    and so on. Typhoons discontinuously bring about major
                    changes to the oceanic physical environment and drastically
                    alternate the habitats of living organisms. Observing how
                    marine environment alters due to typhoons and how living
                    organisms respond to such changes in the coastal area of
                    Sagami Bay extends important knowledge to predict future

                    healthy marine environment.

                  <p>
                    The ocean, unlike land, is a unique environment in which
                    living organisms experience huge pressure alternation. Many
                    marine zooplankton are especially affected by constantly
                    changing pressure due to their vertical migration.

                  <p>
                    In this laboratory, we created pressure equipment to study
                    the influence of pressure on various zooplankton species. We
                    have investigated, using eggs of copepod and krill, how
                    high-pressure influence on egg development. As a result, it
                    was figured out that eggs of several species show different
                    pressure tolerance under high-pressure, as some species
                    showed high hatchability while others indicated low. This
                    result considers that different inhabitable depths, egg
                    production depths and phylogenetic systems are reflected on
                    their eggs different pressure tolerances.

                  <p>
                    Copepods play important roles in marine ecosystem, including
                    a link between primary production and fish. They have some
                    developmental stages during their growth. Above all, first
                    developmental larva which is called nauplius has greatly
                    different appearance compared with the adult. It suggests
                    that this tiny larva can feed on bacterial plankton, which
                    is considered to be too small for the adult to eat.
                    Moreover, nauplius is known as important food item for fish
                    larvae. Elucidation of carbon flux throughout the nauplius
                    is crucial for the understanding of carbon transfer in the
                    marine food webs. In our laboratory, we examine population
                    change, food items and ingestion rate of nauplius by various
                    approaches such as field investigation, laboratory
                    experiment and observation with scanning electron
                    microscope.

                  <p>
                    The sea surface microlayer (SML) is operationally defined as
                    the uppermost 1-mm layer of the ocean surface. The SML
                    covers about 70% of the Earth's surface and is located at
                    the boundary interface between the atmosphere and the ocean.
                    Therefore, the SML plays a vital role in global
                    biogeochemical cycles and climate change due to the
                    regulation of the air-sea transfer processes of gases and
                    particles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Previous studies have shown that microorganisms are
                    significantly enriched in the SML, and the investigation of
                    the microorganisms in the SML is essential for the better
                    understanding of the material cycles through the air-sea
                    interface because they are both the source and sink of the
                    substances in the atmosphere and the ocean. Our laboratory

                    Zooplankton in coral reef ecosystems takes an important role

                  <p>
                    We conducted a joint study with Universiti Kebangsaan
                    Malaysia (UKM) on seasonal changes in biomass and production
                    of zooplankton community in the coral reefs around Tioman
                    Island, Malaysia. We estimated zooplankton community's daily
                    food requirement from their production rates. The result
                    showed the possibility that existing phytoplankton were not
                    enough to cover the food requirement of herbivorous
                    zooplankton, and thus abundant detritus derived from coral
                    mucus could be one of their important food sources. That is
                    to say, phytoplankton and coral mucus-derived detritus are
                    the origins of pelagic ecosystem of Malaysian coral reefs
                    and support the production of zooplankton communities.

                    It is observed that abundance, biomass and composition of
                    zooplankton in coral reefs differ by day and night or within
                    one night. Collecting zooplankton for a short interval of
                    time and observing their daily variation pattern is
                    instrumental to precisely estimate zooplankton production
                    rates.

                  <p>
                    We collected zooplankton from coral reefs in Redang and
                    Tioman Islands every 3 hours for 48 consecutive hours and
                    investigate their diurnal pattern.

                    Food web structure of plankton in coral reefs is so

                    This laboratory and UMT have worked together in Bidong
                    Island on this topic. We have investigated the food chain of

                    collecting them on a regular basis and individually

                    Whereas coral reefs are known as oligotrophic, its high
                    productivity of bacteria has been also reported. This is
                    considered that organic substances derived from coral mucus
                    contributed for the high productivity, and the role of mucus
                    in material cycle within coral reef ecosystems has been
                    attracting high attention in recent years.

                    Tropical corals are exposed to strong ultraviolet radiation
                    (UVR) through the year. In shallow coral-reef waters, the
                    high UVR stress may damage DNA of symbiotic phytoplankton.
                    Observing seasonal variability in UVR penetration and
                    bio-optical factors that absorb light is necessary to

                    in UVR attenuation and bio-optical factors in coral-reef
                    waters near Bidong Island, Malaysia. We have investigated
                    the influence of North-East (NE) monsoon, which strongly
                    affects the East coast of Peninsula Malaysia, , and found

                    between NE monsoon season (November - January) and
                    non-monsoon season (February-October). For example, UVR
                    attenuation during NE monsoon season became shallow. We
                    clarified seasonal variability of UVR penetration in

                    on the earth. Through artificial rearing of E. superba, we

                    their larva, growth rate and molting intervals.

                    largest body length measures beyond 60 mm and its life-span
                    is 5-7 years. E. superba is a key species in the Antarctic
                    ecosystem, which serves as a food source for inhabiting
                    animals, such as birds, whales and penguins. Its biomass,
                    which is nearly 500,000,000 tons, is considered as the
                    largest on the earth, and thus its biology and the amount of
                    resources contained are widely investigated all over the
                    world. We are working on the following research themes in a

                  <p>
                    The Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium is the first institute in
                    the world to have succeeded on artificial rearing of E.
                    superba. Through joint studies with this aquarium, we have
                    been rearing E. superba and observing their growth for
                    physiological ecological researches. Specific topics in our
                    researches include the relationship between the growing rate
                    of eggs and water temperature, the relevance among food
                    quality, molting rate and growing rate of larva, and so on.
                    As a result, the research proved the importance of
                    zooplankton for the growth of E. superba despite the
                    generally-accepted idea which considers phytoplankton as its
                    main food resource.

                    development and behaviors of E. superba
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    Eggs of E. superba are laid near the surface and sink into
                    the ocean. When they go down to the deeper layer, at around
                    the depth of 1,000 to 2,000 m, the eggs hatch and larva move
                    upward to the surface again. Because of this wide-ranging
                    OVM, E. superba face the highest pressure in their lifetime
                    during the early growth stage, such as eggs or larva.
                    Although the development of eggs of E. superba is often
                    studied under the atmospheric pressure, how the eggs are
                    influenced in the actual pressure environment has not been
                    studied much. Moreover, pressure environment is also
                    considered as a potential trigger for the larva's upward
                    movement. Therefore, this laboratory is aiming to reveal how
                    E. superba, on its initial growth stage, is influenced by
                    pressure.

                    parasitizing in the gut of E. superba living in Antarctic
                    Ocean. We researched on the influence of this organism to
                    the growth of krill and their ecological strategies. Also,
                    we investigated where in the body of krill the Protozoa
                    mainly live. Furthermore, we studied the strategy of how the
                    organisms survive in the gut of krill, though the gut also
                    becomes molted when the krill shed its skin.
