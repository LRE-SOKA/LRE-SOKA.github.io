                  Verification experiment for preventing sea desertification in
                  Shin-Kamigoto, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan (2014-2016)
                </h4>
                <p>
                  In rocky areas along the shore, various seaweeds generally
                  grow abundantly from the water's edge to the dozens of meters.
                  Such seaweed beds play an important role as feeding sites
                  and/or safe houses for larvae and juveniles, maintaining their
                  survival rate. Therefore, seaweed beds contribute to
                  conservation of fishery resources. Recently, however, seaweed
                  beds in many coastal areas in Japan have decreased and turned
                  into "Desert seas".
                </p>

                <p>
                  Such sea desertification has also been found and progressing
                  in Shin-Kamigoto, Nagasaki Prefecture located at East China
                  Sea. Sea desertification may be caused by (1) global warming
                  (high water temperature), (2) nutrient shortage in coastal
                  area, (3) feeding damage or (4) man-made coastal change. In
                  2013, our laboratory conducted a field study to clarify
                  seasonal nutrient variation in the surrounding ocean area,
                  Shin-Kamigoto. The obtained results showed that phosphate was
                  clearly lacking in the summer and autumn (Toda 2013, Research
                  report of seasonal nutrient variation in surrounding ocean
                  area, Shin-Kamigoto). Therefore, our laboratory has been
                  engaged on verification experiment for preventing sea
                  desertification by fertilizing nutrients. This research
                  project is a commissioned project by Shin-Kamigoto, Nagasaki
                  Prefecture in Japan (2014-2016).

                  We focused on sewage, which is discharged from living area in
                  Shin-Kamigoto, as a nutrient source (i.e. phosphorus) for
                  cultivating seaweeds. Investigated nutrient circulation system
                  is expected as an effective method for regenerating seaweed
                  beds and improving fisheries yield. We expect that such system
                  can contribute to the development of a sustainable society
                  which uses a concept of nutrient circulation by connecting
                  land with sea.

                <p>
                  In the case of fertilizing nutrient into the ocean, nutrient
                  supply methods should be considered carefully. Rapid nutrient
                  loading into ocean may cause phytoplankton blooms, leading to
                  red tide problem. Therefore, we designed two types of nutrient
                  supply methods (Patent-pending)..
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the proposed methods is the utilization of a
                  highly-functional phosphorous adsorbent "Rintoru(R)".
                  Rintoru(R) (manufactured by Taiheiyo Cement Corporation) is an
                  amorphous calcium silicate hydrate (A-CSH) which has
                  phosphorus recovery ability and excellent handle-ability. This
                  adsorbent has following advantages: (1) the recovered material
                  can be used directly for fertilizer and little residual
                  remains after utilization and (2) phosphorus can be released
                  gradually into ocean (slow nutrient supply).
                </p>

                  <img src="../assets/images/goto-rintoru-en.jpg" />

                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  The other method is utilization of drip watering system. The
                  drip watering, which means watering drop by drop in a slow
                  manner, is originally used for agriculture. In this research
                  project, drip watering tube was applied for supplying nutrient
                  into the ocean. This supply method has following
                  characteristics: (1) intensive nutrient supply can be
                  conducted and therefore nutrient spreading will be prevented,
                  and (2) the amount and period of water supply can be
                  controlled and therefore effective nutrient supply will be
                  achieved.

                <p>
                  We designed two novel seaweeds cultivating systems using
                  Rintoru(R) and drip watering tube. In order to evaluate the
                  effect of investigated systems, two experimental plots with
                  two experimental rafts were set up in coastal area of
                  Shin-Kamigoto, and verification experiment began at October,
                  2014. The experiments are currently underway and amount of
                  seaweed growth and environmental factors have been monitored
                  constantly.

                  This research project has been conducted by joining industry,
                  academia, government and local people. Centering on
                  Shin-Kamigoto, the faculty of engineering of Soka University,
                  the faculty of fisheries of Nagasaki University, Taiheiyo
                  Cement Corporation, Sanyo Techno Marine, fishing people, town
                  people, private sector, regional development bureau of Goto
                  and TAMA-TLO (technology licensing organization) are joining
                  as a team of this research project. The faculty of engineering
                  of Soka University assumes a role for designing, operating and
                  evaluating the investigated nutrient supply system. The
                  faculty of fisheries of Nagasaki University assumes a role for
                  analyzing microbial community dynamics and evaluating
                  productivity in seaweed bed. Taiheiyo Cement Corporation
                  conducts phosphorus recovery and evaluates its efficiency.
                  Sanyo Techno Marine conducts an assistant of verification
                  experiment and evaluates seaweed bed growth.
