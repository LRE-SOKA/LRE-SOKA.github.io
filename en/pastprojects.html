                  Utilization of Biomass Resources by Biological and

                  Abstract:<br />
                  Biological waste treatments, such as methane fermentation,
                  ethanol fermentation and composting, attract attention for
                  their advantages to reduce environmental burden and collect
                  valuable resources. However, as these methods use
                  microbe-based decomposition processes, they involve generation
                  of persistent organic substances as secondary products.
                  Biological waste disposal remains inefficient to be applied to
                  recycling of plant biomass, which contains persistent organic
                  matters like lignin and cellulose. To construct an efficient
                  low-carbon society, it is imperative to efficiently recycle
                  and reuse organic resources emitted from human activities. The
                  previous section introduced our participation in Academic
                  Research Development Projects for Private Universities
                  (2004-2008), where we investigated and developed methane
                  fermentation technologies for high degradability and efficient
                  energy recovery of the entire disposal system by using aerobic
                  and anaerobic decomposing processes. However, the previous
                  project was targeted at highly-degradable materials such as
                  raw garbage; it was not developed enough for efficient use of
                  entire biomass resources emitted from human activities in a
                  highly developed low-carbon society. This project carried on
                  the previous research on further efficiency of the degradative
                  process of organic wastes and also worked on two different
                  researches; productive process of aquatic biomass like
                  monocellular algae as a potential biomass energy source and
                  gasification process of persistent organic matters.
                  Researching these processes all together enables us to
                  investigate and develop the efficient recycling of biomass
                  resources emitted from the entire human society.

                  Abstract:<br />
                  Marine fouling organisms such as blue mussel are discharged
                  both heavily and intermittently from electric power plants in
                  coastal areas, harbor facilities and ships. These "saline
                  organic solid wastes" are difficult to be used as feeds or
                  fertilizers due to its high salinity and are also known to
                  inhibit methane fermentation process. For these
                  characteristics, 90% of such marine fouling organisms are
                  incinerated or wind up in landfills in Japan. However, it is
                  an urgent task to develop technologies to utilize them as
                  biomass resources. Especially, methane fermentation attracts
                  attention as one of the more efficient recycling technologies
                  of organic wastes for its high energy productivity. However,
                  it remains difficult to become widespread in the society due
                  to high cost for ancillary facilities, chemicals for
                  solid-liquid separation and energy for effluent disposal.
                  <br />
                  In this project, based on our previous studies and
                  technological seeds related to salinity tolerance and
                  aerobic/anaerobic decomposition in methane fermentation
                  processes, we aim to lower the cost for the treatment by
                  adding multifunction to single reactor. We investigated and
                  developed technology to integrate the multifunctional reactor,
                  that conducted both aerobic and anaerobic decompositions, in
                  the simultaneous process that managed separation of liquid and
                  solid as well as aerobic decomposition .

                  Our collaborating institute, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh
                  Nopember (ITSN) is one of the best universities majoring in
                  science in Indonesia, with its main campus located in
                  Surabaya, the second largest city in the country. ITSN and
                  Soka University started academic exchange in 2006 and we have
                  been working together solving environmental problems in
                  Indonesia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to tackle environmental problems, it is imperative
                  for education to take two approaches: acquiring scientific
                  expertise and promoting high consciousness of environmental
                  problems. From this standpoint, our joint project is called
                  SEED (Environmental Science, Engineering and Education for
                  Sustainable Development). It aims for a more wide-ranging,
                  liberal and significant academic exchange by opening it up to
                  not only students and faculties of the Faculty of Engineering,
                  but also to those of Education. Specific focuses of this
                  project are 1) research on energy collection from direct
                  incineration of waste materials 2) research on collection of
                  heavily-concentrated methane using microorganisms 3) research
                  on disposal process of leachate discharged from landfills due
                  to rainfalls and other causes 4) educational activities aiming
                  to raise consciousness of environmental issues.

                </h5>
                <p>
                  Abstract:<br />
                  Although organic wastes contain a lot of carbon sources which
                  is reusable as fertilizer or energy, in Japan, nearly all of
                  them are incinerated or wind up in a landfill. In recent
                  years, these disposal methods are becoming causes of many
                  environmental problems, such as chronic shortage of spaces for
                  final disposal sites and generation of toxic chemical
                  compounds such as dioxin. In such social condition,
                  organic-waste disposal is expected to be done at waste sources
                  in order to reduce the cost for transportation and prevent
                  generation of fermentation residue. <br />
                  As introduced in the previous section, from 2002 to 2003, this
                  laboratory participated in Local Consortium
                  Research-Development Project and investigated the
                  high-degradative disposal of organic matters using aerobic
                  processes of solid and liquid phases. In this project, we
                  applied the previously-mentioned aerobic process to the
                  methane fermentation process (anaerobic process) and further
                  developed it to an efficient and high-degradative
                  methane-recovery process. We aimed to structure an efficient
                  entire disposal system where compound organic matters (such as
                  activated sludge produced from aerobic process) are recycled
                  to the methane fermentation through the combination of aerobic
                  and anaerobic processes. Moreover, the targeted organic
                  matters in this study were not limited to food waste; algae
                  was also investigated for its possible availability as biomass
                  energy.

                </h5>
                <p>
                  Abstract:<br />
                  While nearly all of food waste (organic waste) is incinerated
                  in Japan, generation of toxic chemical compounds such as
                  dioxin and the increasing energy and cost required for
                  disposal have been considered as serious subsidiary issues in
                  recent years. As a result, biological disposal of organic
                  waste has attracted much attention as a safer method, and
                  energy-recovery processes through refuse compost or methane
                  fermentation have been studied and partially adopted. Waste
                  volume reduction is another serious issue especially in urban
                  areas, because it is difficult to find spaces for final
                  disposal sites. Considering the cost for collecting wastes,
                  high-quality volume reductions at waste sources are highly
                  needed. Moreover, as apartments and high-rise condominiums are
                  getting larger in urban areas, it is becoming more common for
                  garbage disposal to be done in each building using a disposer
                  with an expensive activated sludge tank. These various ways of
                  dealing with waste issues indicate diversified needs for waste
                  disposal in the current society. Therefore, in this project,
                  we developed a food waste disposal cyclical system of aerobic
                  solid-phase disposal (composting process) and aerobic
                  liquid-phase disposal (activated sludge process). This system
                  is expected to be applied in urban areas and achieve the high
                  food waste decomposition rate.

                  As an effort for environmental restoration technologies to
                  restore lost coral reefs, we are developing new artificial
                  fish beds which are developed considering the corals' changing
                  environmental preferences during their growth. In the fish
                  bed, diverse microhabitats are artificially arranged in order
                  to observe inquiline selectivity of larvas and their
                  adaptation in the complex physical circumstances. Based on the
                  result, we are going to suggest new designs for artificial
                  fish beds and contribute to coral breeding projects and
                  restoration of their ecosystems.
