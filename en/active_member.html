        My research focuses on microalgal cultivation, ranging
        from wastewater treatment, nutrients extraction and

        Hi My name is Pranshu Bhatia and I am a first year
        master's student at Soka University in the faculty of
        Engineering . The topics in which I am interested are
        Waster Water Treatment and Production of high value
        Microalgae . I want to work in the field of environment
        to make this environment a better place to live in for
        all the living beings ( Humans , Animals and Plants ). I
        am really determined to work harder under my professor

        Hi. My name is saki. I love listening to foreign music
        and doing exercise. I studied abroad to Canada for 8
        months and after that I joined this lab. My research is
        about mass cultivation of marine diatom. In the future
        I'd like to be a wonderful woman and enjoy my life.
